Welcome to my website. I hope you like it. This place used to be called MixedLaughs in case you didn't know, by the way.

I used to host it with AwardSpace on mixedlaughs.tk (free domain via dot.tk), but A) mixedlaughs.tk was blocked by my school district and B) dot.tk took my free domain and forced me to pay 20 bucks a month which is stupid for a website ending with tk. I mean, seriously, nobody's gonna pay actual money for a tk extension. Geez. I moved it to GitHub Pages before this happened, though. I'm still using it because now I'm competent at coding and GitHub is nice.

Anyways you can poke around at some of my projects here.

## JavaScript Message

JavaScript Message is a shitty little in-school messaging platform intended to be an anonymous Discord-esque place. It originally used Google's Firebase as the main database, but the current version actually stores its messages via a Discord bot. Horrible, I know.

## Gnome Fighter+

Gnome Fighter: Thanksgiving Edition was created my freshman year of high school on MIT App Inventor. For a while there was a terrible online port of it, but I recently rebuilt it from the ground up. Now it uses CSS and img tags. Ugh.

## Twitch Tetris

Twitch Tetris seized my school by storm freshman year. That was until a mass-blocking by school admins. I took it upon myself to port it to my website (and then spruce it up a bit cause I'm not a thief). I emailed the original creator and he was like "sure buddy" so it's allowed, too.

## Russian Roulette

Originally, this was also an MIT App Inventor project like Gnome Fighter. Basically it's Russian Roulette but the bullet is playing an incredibly loud rendition of the Wii Sports theme in an attempt to break your eardrums. It's kinda fun to dick around with it with friends.

## Crab Simulator

Crab Simulator is a text-based introspective dive into the human psyche using crabs as a medium. Haha just kidding, it's a cool thingy based on a game my friend made, then we joined forces and made this. It was made using Python 3, which was compiled into an exe, downloadable at the cartridge titled "CRAB PY." I ported it to the web a while ago, playable at the cartridge titled "CRAB WEB." And then a few months ago we used the Crab Simulator concept as a base for some coding competition we entered and made a kid-friendly spinoff, playable at the cartridge titled "CRAB TSA."

## Hangman

The [Coolmath Games hangman](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-hangman) is very popular among Hangman aficionados. Unfortunately, the entire site's blocked by school admins. I made my own hangman using the same word list available to everyone on my website along with some sick additions like a leaderboard.

Cool yeah that's it. Thanks for checking this repository out.
